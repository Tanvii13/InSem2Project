## Introduction
Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle video game. Players move tetrominoes, which move down the playing field, to fill horizontal lines. The completed lines disappear, granting the player points, and all other blocks move down the corresponding number of lines.

## Game Components
The game consists of several key components that contribute to its functionality and gameplay experience.

### Tetrominoes
The game features different shapes of blocks (tetrominoes) that fall from the top of the screen. The player can rotate and move these blocks to fit them into empty spaces. The tetrominoes include:

- I (Straight line)
- O (Square)
- T (T-shape)
- L and J (L-shaped blocks)
- S and Z (Zig-zag blocks)
